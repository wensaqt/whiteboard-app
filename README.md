# About this project

This project's "raison d'Ãªtre" is just to train myself to manipulate Vue.js. It's certainly not professional, and the code will probably have to be reworked afterwards.

## Todos

- Fix the app's use on Chrome, which has many display bugs for some reason
- Make note handling more flexible: add resizing, and make them persistent when switching boards (like checklists)
- Add image placeholders
- Make the app fully responsive

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).
